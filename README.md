# 👋 Hey there! I'm Andrey 🚀  

🎓 I'm a student at **Moscow Polytechnic University**, studying **Fullstack Development**.  

💙 I have a strong interest in **C++** and love exploring its capabilities in both **GUI (Qt)** and **server-side development**. Currently, I'm diving deeper into **Linux, multithreading, and architecture design**. My Fullstack studies help me understand how different parts of a system interact, making my development approach more holistic.  

I enjoy writing **clean, efficient, and scalable code**, applying **best practices, design patterns**, and performance optimization techniques.
