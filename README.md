👋 Hey there! I'm Andrey
🚀 Passionate C++ Developer, crafting high-performance applications and exploring new technologies.

Currently, I'm working on C++ applications for both GUI (Qt) and server-side development. At the same time, I'm diving deeper into Qt Framework, Boost.Asio, and Linux development, constantly improving my skills and seeking elegant solutions.

I enjoy writing clean, efficient, and scalable code, following best practices, design patterns, and multithreading principles. Working across both Windows and Linux, I focus on performance optimization and architecture. Alongside that, I have some experience in full-stack development, which helps me understand how systems work as a whole.

🛠 Tech Stack & Expertise
💡 C++ – My primary language, where I feel most at home.
📚 STL & Design Patterns – Leveraging the power of standard libraries and writing structured, maintainable code.
⚙️ Multithreading & Performance Optimization – Making applications fast and efficient.
🖥 Qt Framework – Building modern GUI applications.
🐧 Linux & Windows Development – Comfortable working in both environments.
📌 CMake – Managing builds and project configurations.
🐘 PostgreSQL – Understanding relational databases and data handling.
🛠 Git – Keeping track of changes, collaborating seamlessly.

🎵 Beyond Coding
Outside of development, I’m into football, equestrian sports, music, and financial analysis. Whether it's strategizing on the field, enjoying a good ride, diving into market trends, or just vibing to great music, I believe a balance of interests fuels creativity.

Always open to new challenges, collaborations, and exciting projects. Let’s build something amazing together! 🚀
